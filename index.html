      <h2>Protect International Students</h2>
      <p>Student education should not be used as a political pawn. The Trump administration's arbitrary decision against international students is inhumane and
        the case for international students should be independent of "economic gains" states and institutions have. If you are a Johns Hopkins University student
        or alumni concerned for your classmates, please click on the link below to send an email to university officials of your affiliation! It takes one minute.
      </p>
      <p>If you have any feedbacks or questions, you can reach me <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn5ibnTa3zVmzYFdd5n0pt1XE0lL8XEOIF33NMc3gdyH7QTA/viewform" target="_blank"
