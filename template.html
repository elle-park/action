        Dear President Daniels, Provost Kumar, Dean [Name], and members of the President's Cabinet,<br>

        I am an [undergraduate/graduate] student currently attending Johns Hopkins University in the [affiliation school]. I’m writing on behalf of all the international students in the country and in our university impacted by the recent ICE policy
        issued on July 6th. As you are aware, ICE is threatening to remove all international students whose schools and universities have moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are forcing international students to risk their health to
        maintain their immigration status by making them take classes in-person to avoid deportation. They have also stated that if a school moves online for ANY reason, international students will have to leave the country. This means that if
        schools shut down due to virus surges, international students will have no option but to flee the country to avoid deportation. With JHU's currently planned hybrid system, this puts students in a tricky spot - there has to be a plan devised
        to protect these students and allow them to plan for their future as soon as possible. Many graduate students also have dependents and family members on the F-2 visa. This not only threatens the Hopkins student’s education, but also the
        future of their families.<br>

        Students are well aware of Johns Hopkins' ability for political lobbying. Johns Hopkins is one of the largest private employers in the state and part of the top 10 companies that spent the most on lobbyists in the state of Maryland. We urge
        you to use the resources you have to request local and state policymakers to direct their attention to revoking the harmful ICE policies. Students have not forgotten that our university ended the contract with ICE only in 2019. Use those
        monetary compensation towards helping your students.<br>

        If Hopkins cares about all students, including their international students, University leadership should do more to protect them. This includes coming up with a comprehensive plan and a promise to confront the local and federal government to
        maintain the student visa status. Peer universities, such as Harvard and MIT, have already gone as far as taking legal action against the Trump administration and we expect the same passion from our administration.<br>

        No one should have to choose between COVID-19 and deportation. International students are an integral part of the Johns Hopkins community.<br>

        Sincerely,<br>
        NAME<br>
        Whiting School of Engineering<br>
        JHU EMAIL (optional)<br>
